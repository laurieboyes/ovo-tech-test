# Ovo tech test - Tariff comparison

## Pre-built executables located in the `dist` directory for your convenience

```
./dist/usage greener-energy power 40
./dist/cost 2000 2300
```

## Or roll your own

Requires [Node.js 8.11.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm 6 (which you'll get when you download node)

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Run tests with `npm test`

Generate executable to `dist/` directory with `npm run build`


## Things that I might improve on given more time

* Certainly if there were going to be more people than just myself working on this, I'd set up some code linting with eslint
